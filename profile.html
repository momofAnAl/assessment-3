            <h3>About me</h3>
            <div>
                <p>I am a stay-at-home mom who has been 
                prioritizing my family for the past six years. 
                Before that, I had a background in education and hospitalization management, 
                where I gained valuable skills in communication, organization, and leadership. 
                Recently, I have been self-studying coding and web development, 
                as I have a keen interest in the tech industry and want to improve my skills 
                and knowledge in this area. 
                My goal is to become financially independent and support my family and community, 
                especially women and gender-diverse people.
                </p>
